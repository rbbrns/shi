## Running Tests

To run the tests, ensure you are in the project's root directory and use the following command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This command temporarily adds the current directory to your Python path, allowing the test runner to find the `shi` package.
